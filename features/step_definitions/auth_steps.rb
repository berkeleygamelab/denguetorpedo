# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with users

Given /the following users exist/ do |users_table|
  users_table.hashes.each do |user|
    # each returned element will be a hash whose key is the table header.
    # you should arrange to add that user to the database here.
    User.create!(user)
  end
