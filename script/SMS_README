== SMS system documentation

Our SMS system connect to Gmail and process emails in our Gmail account - denguereport
To start running the SMS system along with the web server on the localhost, simply execute the following command in the terminal:

  foreman start
  
This command will execute the Procfile in the project folder. The Procfile specifies our application to start a web process and a worker process.
It is almost common nowadays that a web application will require some kind worker process that handles background tasks. This is exactly what the 
Procfile is doing. The two commands are:
  
  web: bundle exec thin start -p $PORT
  worker: bundle exec rake starting_mail_poller
  
The first command executes a Thin web server and the second command executes a rake task "starting_mail_poller"
